\title{Decision Tree Training}
\usage{
decision_tree_train(data, target, max_depth = 10, current_depth = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the input features and target variable.}

\item{target}{A string specifying the name of the target variable in the data.}

\item{max_depth}{The maximum depth of the decision tree. Default is 10.}

\item{current_depth}{The current depth of the tree during the recursive training process. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A list representing the decision tree.
}
\description{
This function trains a decision tree recursively using a greedy algorithm. 
It selects the best feature and split point at each node to maximize information gain, 
and continues until a maximum depth is reached or the data at a node is homogeneous.

\examples{
\dontrun{
    data(iris)
    tree <- decision_tree_train(iris, target = "Species", max_depth = 5)
    str(tree)
